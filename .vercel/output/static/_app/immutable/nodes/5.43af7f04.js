Eventually at some point as I became more ambitious with my development, I refined my workflow which lead me to develop my own plugins, addons, and macros to expediate my development process. For example I made my own custom 3D skeleton rigging utility that effectively reduce my work time by half. I always found the process rewarding. Even further more when I shared my tools for others to use. I felt fulfillment in being able to help others like this. That&#39;s the reason I pursued computer science as a major, since I believe that was the pathway into how I can help others in the world, a grand mission for me.
