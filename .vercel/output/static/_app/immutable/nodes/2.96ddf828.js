        I am William Xue, Welcome to my website! 
        I am a Comp Sci student of University of Colorado Boulder, from 2018 to 2022
        <p>I have a passion in <span class="Emphasis svelte-1aq4zi9">Programming</span> and <span class="Emphasis svelte-1aq4zi9">Video Production</span>, but I&#39;ve had experience in a broad range of fields, Including Robotics, Database Management, Full-stack development, many more</p> <p>I&#39;ve picked up many languages over my experiences, c, c++, c#, Python, Scala, Lua</p>`,c,o,C=`<h1 class="Emphasis svelte-1aq4zi9">Where I began</h1> <p>I started my career in to computer science when I was in Middle School in 2012, through <span class="Emphasis svelte-1aq4zi9">game development</span> on the now massively popular game development platform &quot;Roblox&quot;. 
        From producing rudimentary programs to short form experiences, my start into programming was humble but critically formative.</p> <p>In highschool I took a <span class="Emphasis svelte-1aq4zi9">video productions</span> class and found myself in love with post-production through the Final Cut Pro video editing program.
